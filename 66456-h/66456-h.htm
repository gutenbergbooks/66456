<hr class="chap" />

<p>"You must realize," squealed the squat, ugly creature in the hastily
constructed wooden cage, "that you're inviting certain destruction by
holding me prisoner. I warn you, your time is short."</p>

<p>Walt Granger stomped over to the enclosure and swung a heavy boot
against one of the two-by-fours that stood like a crooked row of
sentries. "That's my worry," he grunted.</p>

<p>He had stumbled upon the whole business just two hours before, right in
the middle of his part of the geoglogic survey that was going on in the
rock strewn hills and gullies known on the maps as the Millsport Range.
He had seen the ship the moment it left the ground, and a few yards
from the burned circle of grass that was still smoldering from the
rocket blast, there sat the fat little specimen of life from another
world. Granger had caught the thing by surprise and had a rope around
its middle before it could scamper into the brush.</p>

<p>"My comrades will return for me," warned the thing, its yellowish
eyes slowly and rhythmically protruding and withdrawing within their
sockets. "They'll have no trouble finding you, and when they do...."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Granger, pulling on his leather jacket. He turned
to the cement fireplace and gave the embers a poke with a charred
stick, looking around at the cage every few seconds as though he feared
leaving his back turned for more than instant.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. Eight o'clock, and night was fast spreading a
blanket of charcoal shadows over the hillsides. He'd wait till morning
to move this crazy beast to the next camp six miles away. A night trip
might entail chances he wasn't willing to take.</p>

<p>After a couple of nervous fumbles with a match, he lit a cigarette
and glanced uneasily out the one window in the rough cabin. What if
the alien, or whatever it was, wasn't kidding about the danger he was
in? What if his buddies did decide to come back before morning with
the extermination of a human on their minds? Think of it, Granger, he
told himself laconically, you'd be a hero! A nice, cold, dead one. And
they'd never find the bunch who'd have knocked him off. He'd be one of
those "mysterious deaths" the papers played up.</p>

<p>"Free me immediately!" screeched the angry captive, his head swaying
like a balloon on a stick. "You haven't much time left!"</p>

<p>"You're a nasty tempered little imp, aren't you?" growled Granger as he
strode across the room and peeked curiously inside the crate.</p>

<p>"I loathe you," growled the thing. "I have no intentions of deceiving
you. This whole situation is simply a matter of pure logic so far as
your plight is concerned."</p>

<p>"You're forgetting," said Granger, his voice lacking a certain amount
of its previous confidence, "that you're the one who's in a mess."</p>

<p>"Only temporarily, you fool!" raved the creature, jumping frantically
up and down. "Look!" he screamed, pointing a tiny hand toward the
window over Granger's left shoulder.</p>

<p>The geologist gasped as he shot a quick glance in the direction of the
thing's outstretched arm. A pale green light had turned the surrounding
land and sky into an eerie dawn that extended its weird phosphorescence
into the cabin itself. And two hundred yards from the cabin, in a small
area relatively clear of major obstructions, was the same ship he had
seen a few hours before.</p>

<p>"They're here!" shouted the alien. "Let me out!"</p>

<p>Granger slammed shut the door and lifted a massive oak bar into iron
brackets on either side. Then he was at the window again. A hatch near
the bottom of the craft was open, but there was no sign of movement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then he saw one of them, an exact duplicate of his captive, running
from bush to bush about fifty feet from the ship. A few steps behind
him was another. Two more nearby scrambled over an immense boulder and
scurried into the brush. Another five were emerging, like a patrol of
midgets, from a ravine to the north of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Be sensible, you idiot!" snarled the thing in the crate. "I'm giving
you this final chance. Unlock this contrivance, and all will be well
with you. I'll speak on your behalf."</p>

<p>"So you can lead your buddies right back here? Sure," said Granger,
"that's all I'd have to do to finish myself off in a real hurry."</p>

<p>"Do as I say!" yelled the alien. "For your own sake!"</p>

<p>"Look," panted Granger, "I know I was crazy to fool with you in the
first place, but now that you're here and they're outside, you're
staying, see?"</p>

<p>He reached under the lumpy pile of cotton that served as a mattress
and pulled out his .30-30 rifle. Little Boy Blue and his pop gun, he
thought. He grabbed a handful of cartridges from a box under the bed
and began jamming them into the magazine.</p>

<p>"That will be of no use, my friend," droned a hollow voice behind him.</p>

<p>Granger spun himself around just as a pane of glass in the window flew
to pieces under the impact of a short, shiny gun barrel. A perfect
reproduction of the face of the creature in the cage centered itself
in the jagged frame of the broken window and gave him the shadow of a
smile that was closer to a victorious leer.</p>

<p>"Put down your weapon," the newcomer ordered coldly.</p>

<p>Get that rifle up fast, Granger commanded himself.</p>

<p>"I repeat," said the face at the window. "Lower your weapon."</p>

<p>They'll let you have it anyway, Granger thought grimly. He slowly
curled his finger around the trigger and started to move when he was
jarred off his feet by a roaring blast that ripped the door from its
hinges and sent it crashing against the rear wall of the cabin.</p>

<p>Outside the ruined entrance stood a group of aliens all armed.
Fearfully, he looked to the window, but their leader was gone. In a
second he appeared at the door, moved inside the cabin, and Granger
automatically stepped back, his hazy mind calculating roughly the few
feet of escape route remaining to him. In a moment he was there, his
back flattened against the cabin wall.</p>

<p>The short creature kept coming on, its murky orbs fixed on Granger's
white, drawn countenance. Then it stopped its advance.</p>

<p>"So you have one of our people," it said in a voice that twanged like
piano wire.</p>

<p>Granger tried once in vain for his voice, then gave up. He stared over
the head of his foe at the silent assembly outside the cabin, then at
the thing in the packing crate. It was sitting there, quiet, immobile,
but intently watching the scene between the earthman and his visitor.</p>

<p>"You are holding one of us captive," the commander remarked. "This is
a most unfortunate situation, indeed." The small figure stepped aside
quickly and waved an arm.</p>

<p>Granger, perspiration trickling down his face, watched a score of
glistening weapons raised and pointed inside the cabin. For a second
he looked directly at the menacing horde. Then his eyes saw nothing. A
blazing flash of white light burst forth from the doorway, and it was
all over.</p>

<p>Granger forced open his aching eyes and squinted in the direction of
the fiery blast, but the doorway was empty. The commander was still
there, though, walking slowly to the door.</p>

<p>Why am I alive? Granger asked himself incredulously. Or am I dead? He
bumped his fist against his forehead once or twice and gave his head
a vigorous shake. Suddenly, he turned his gaze to the cage. But he saw
nothing that resembled the rebuilt packing crate; only a mound of ashes
and twisted spikes. In the center of the heap, like a fat, dwarfish
king astride his fallen kingdom, was the charred, blackened shell of
the grotesque creature that had once occupied the wooden cell.</p>

<p>Then he moved cautiously toward the door and stared, speechless, at the
leader of the expedition.</p>

<p>"We shall depart now," said the being. "Thank you for helping us."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not much later, across the silent reaches of space, a communications
operator on another planet looked up from his receiving equipment and
handed his superior a message just transmitted from a ship leaving the
planet Earth: RETURN MISSION SUCCESSFUL. DESERTER LOCATED AND EXECUTED.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
